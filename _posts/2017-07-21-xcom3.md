I finally found the time to finish my xcom aliens. 

For the Thin Men I wasn't sure about painting them the navy they are in the game as I thought it wouldn't show well or would match too close the colour of the Greys. So I started with grey for the suits. After the first one though I wasn't happy, the grey doesnt appear evil or dangerous enough. So I finished a pair so they would at least match and then moved to navy for the last 3. This looked much better to be honest and I'm quite happy with the results. I have 5 more of the same models if I want to do more Thin Men, though I might do actual Men in Black for actual 15mm gaming.

For the Mutons I went with green armour like they are in the game. I thought it might look odd since it is the green I base the models in. In the end I think it looks good, and the yellow highlights add some more colour variety to my alien models.

With that I've finished my xcom aliens for now. Now it is time to find some rules to play them with! Also to paint up some xcom soliders.
