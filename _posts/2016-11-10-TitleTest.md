*My experiment with a automated proccess to mail blog posts to git, looks like it is nearly there!*


I would like a link to [Google](www.google.com) so that it is quick to search.

And then an image

<p align="center">
<a href="http://whilegaming.github.io/img/postImage.jpg"><img src="http://whilegaming.github.io/img/postImage.jpg" alt=":this is a post image" width="500"></a>
</p>

Finish
