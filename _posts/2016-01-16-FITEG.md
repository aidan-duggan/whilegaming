>_I don't think its fair to review a game without a lot of plays so instead I will do First Impressions posts based on early plays, with full reviews following if I play the game enough_


Recently I got the opportunity to play two new board games. Tiny Epic Galaxies, a recent purchase of mine, and Last Will brought along by my friend.

###[Tiny Epic Galaxies](http://www.gamelyngames.com/games/tiny-epic-galaxies) (TEG)
+ Type: Dice Combo-ing/Engine Building MicroGame
+ Players: 1-5
+ Time: 30 minutes
+ Age: 13+

I played [Tiny Epic Kingdoms](http://www.gamelyngames.com/games/tiny-epic-kingdoms/) a lot at Gaelcon and enjoyed it so I went looking for a copy. I found TEG which had slightly better [reviews on boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163967/tiny-epic-galaxies) and has a theme I prefer (Space!). It was very well priced at around 20 euro.

_I've become more of a fan of small boxes as my boardgame collection has grown._

####Contents
The game consists of game mat and counters for each player, 7 dice and a deck of planet cards around which the game is based. The box is only about 3 inches by 6 and all the contents are on the small size to fit (hence the name). 

####Theme
The players are in charge of a space empire expanding into a new galaxy. They are each competing to colonise new planets and improve their empire. The theme works well with nice art and design, and all the pieces are quality.

_This was towards the end of the game and things were not going well for me..._
####Play
Play revolves around rolling 'action' dice and performing the relevant actions in the order of your choice. You can gain resources (culture/energy), colonise planets, move your spaceships around or perform actions on your colonised planets. There is also a unique rule where other players can pay to do the action you just did, which adds interesting decisions to the game.

####Thoughts
The game seems to have a lot of luck but there are also a lot of decisions for the players to make. It took a while for everyone to get the hang of the game and figure out how to play. It took about 1 hour which I felt was a little longer then I wanted but we also had to learn the rules first to be fair. I lost miserably which I'll try to blame on luck....
Overall I enjoyed playing but lossing badly soured the experience. I need to play more to get a proper feel but lossing should never be unfun in a boardgame! It has a lot of interesting complexity for its size but a lot of randomness.
I will try to play a few more games but I'm not excited to do so. I definitely like the box though!

###First Impression:
_Interested in playing again_

I'll do my First Impression of Last Will next time.
