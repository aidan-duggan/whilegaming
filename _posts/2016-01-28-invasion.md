So I have my [idea](http://whilegaming.github.io/2016-01-10-commander), but the challenge is putting it all together given
some self imposed constraints. The main hope is to be able to use my
existing 20mm miniatures and my buildings so what I get has to fit
with that. Unfortunately these requirements did not make that easy...

What I need is an assortment of aliens to play the invasion force. In
xcom it is a united hodge podge of alien species that attacks earth. Each
species has its own style, thankfully this transfers nicely for me
into not requiring all the models come from the same company and have
the same aesthetic!

Alas though it seems 20mm aliens are not very common! My plan is
looking shaky. In my desperation I started searching for 15mm aliens.
[Sectoids](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Sectoid_(EU2012)) , the weakest enemy in xcom, are smaller than humans so
I was hopeful I'd find something at that scale that would work.

I found classic [Greys in 15mm at rebel miniatures](http://www.rebelminis.com/15algrar.html) that looked
perfect. My guess was they are human sized at 15mm which I hoped would
work out as 4ft high aliens at 20mm! When I got them I was right and
quite happy with how they look, they are perhaps a little small and
thin but that suits them being weak and numerous rather than of equal
stature to humans.

15mm is very cheap and postage from the US makes most of the cost so I
took a risk on a few other miniatures. One enemy in xcom are [Thin Men](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Thin_Man_(EU2012)),
they are gangly secret service looking humanoids, but with sickly pale
skin, the invasion forces poor attempt at disguise I guess. So I got
some 15mm [Men in Black type models](http://www.rebelminis.com/15mmmeninblack.html), figuring I could go for
hobbit sized instead of gangly, and at worst I could play them as 15mm
with the other aliens. I'm not sure yet if they will really work as
they are very small looking, time will tell.

I also found [brutish looking 15mm aliens](http://www.rebelminis.com/5150aliens.html), which are meant to be
very large at 15mm. I hoped they would be human sized at 20mm and work
as xcom [Mutons](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Muton_(EU2012)). In reality they are a bit shorter, but are
definitely wider so I think they will work. I only got two as a trial
so if they work well I'll likely buy more otherwise I'll have to find
something else.

With the invasion force getting under way humanity needs a faster
reaction force and for that they are going to need to fancy
transportation. Luckily the engineers are hard at work building a
[Skyranger](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Skyranger_(EU2012))! so stay tuned!
