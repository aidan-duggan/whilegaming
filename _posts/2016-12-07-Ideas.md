I started reading Jeff Atwoods blog [Coding Horror](www.codinghorror.com) when I was in
college. It's very good, I learnt a great deal from it. It is unfortunate
that it is no longer regularly updated. One of his thoughts that really
stuck with me is his view on ideas vs executions. To quote him: “Success is
rarely determined by the quality of your ideas. But it is frequently
determined by the quality of your execution.”. I think this captures 2 very
important things about creating something.

First, ideas alone are not really worth anything, the idea has to be
actually put into practice if you really want to get something out of the
idea (more ideas, learning, recognition, money, whatever). Everyone has
ideas about things, very few actually execute on their ideas, fewer still
get something for just providing the idea.

Second, quality of execution is what is really important, there are many
media, products, companies out there that had an original idea and executed
on it poorly and thought the idea was worthless. Some time later somebody
else tries again but with a better quality or better focus and are
successful (though hard to describe, we know quality when we see it).

<p align="center"><i> The Apple Newton was iPhone before technology was there to deliver with a high enough quality.</i></p>

To me this concept is important, for things I really care about I try to
focus very strongly on the quality for what I do. I try to take care of the
details. In my programming career I focus on the quality of my work because
it leaves better lasting impression then poor work done faster (people will
quickly forget it was done fast). For this website for example I'm trying
to keep it minimal as I don't have the time to do fancy features properly,
but I also want it to show some originality to make me more invested in it.

It also encourages one to try and share ideas, and to help others with
their ideas. Very few people are interested in stealing your ideas and few
still could execute on it if they did. When people are sharing ideas it is
also better to suggest where the quality could be improve rather then if
the idea is good or not. You can advice them on delivering their idea
better and not sound critical as asking if their idea is good in the first
place.

In this spirit I'm going to start sharing ideas for games that I have. It
will provide me a place to document my thoughts, share them with those who
are interested and if someone wants to use one then I'll be able to see one
of my ideas in action! It will also help me generate content for this site
and maybe encourage me to execute on my ideas by fleshing them out more.
