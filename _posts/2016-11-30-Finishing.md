_Alas due to moving house I do not have any middle stage photographs._

With the Skyranger [ready to paint](http://whilegaming.github.io/2016-11-25-Putting) I had to decide how I wanted to
paint it! My preferred aesthetic, as with the [Thin Men](http://whilegaming.github.io/2016-11-14-Greys), is something
simple with solid blocks of colours. This is primarily because it is easier
for me to paint. I took a picture of the model and on my computer drew the
outline of the various parts. Then I experimented with different
combinations of colours. The original Skyranger is grey so naturally that
is the core colour. The xcom logo is generally either a yellow or blue so I
figured highlighting the model with those colours would make it easy for me
to match it with future models.

Once I had decided the colours it was straightforward job to paint. A core
grey for the body, a light grey to highlight raised features and a dark
grey for engines and thrusters. I then used thin black lines to improve the
suggestion of armour plates / military style and to effect where there
should be things like doors.

just flat wood.

Since the model has no actual raised or indented sections I had to paint
the various electronics and lights flat onto the model. For the front
lights I used blue with black border and the back lights are red with
border (Do military vehicles beep when reversing?...).

to crave grooves.

A final finish was the xcom logo on the front and tail, which took a few
tries! Overall I'm very happy with how the model looks. It's very
simplistic, I didn't do any weathering which would probably add a lot, but
since the model is not very detailed I think it better to lean into the
simplicity. I have yet to varnish it but I might leave that in case
anything comes up to add to it.
