I've started to record the boardgames I play on a page on this website [Game Diary](https://aidan-duggan.github.io/whilegaming/gamediary). The aim is to record the games I have played so that I can look back and remember the fun I have had. 

I know its possible to record these things on facebook, or on boardgamegeek but I wanted something more personal. Also since it takes a lot of effort for me to write blog posts I wanted an excuse to add small content to this site in an easier way.

To make it easier for me I have even create a personnal android app to quickly create the template for each diary entry and upload it to the site. Those who are curious can find the code here [AGit](https://github.com/aidan-duggan/AGit). It is really just a modification of an existing android app.

Hopefully this will mean I use this web more, each diary entry will include a small opinion that maybe others will find useful also, and each year I'll be able to look back at what I played and look forward to what I'll get to play in the future.
