My name is Aidan Duggan, I'm an avid gamer of all types of games, though particularly boardgames. In my professional time I'm a software engineer.

This blog will sporadically follow my adventures in gaming, with perhaps the odd programming tangent.

This site is powered by Jekyll and GitHub, mostly as an excuse for me to learn more about Git and I quite like the cleanliness and simplity of static html pages. Lets see how long I last before jumping to something that looks fancier!
