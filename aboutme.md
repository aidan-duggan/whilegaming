My name is Aidan Duggan, I'm avid gamers of all types, though particularly boardgames. For a living I'm a Java software developer working for a financial software company.

This blog will sporadically follow my adventures in gaming, with perhaps the odd programming tangent.

This site is powered by Jykell and GitHub, mostly as an excuse for me to learn more about Git and I quite like the purity and simplity of static html pages. Lets see how long a last before jumping to something that looks fancier!
