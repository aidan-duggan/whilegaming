#### Introduction

Learning from others is central to creating something new. Great works are often built on the research and development of others. To that end I have purchased some game design books to help me with my own project. 
First up is Clockwork Game Design by Keith Burgun. Clockwork Game Design is a compact 146 page book about how to design a strategy game. It tries to be generic to the system, boardgame or computer game. Instead focusing on what should be the focus of the designer when building a strategy game.

#### Content

The book outlines what it sees as two main forms of game design. Patchwork game design where rules and systems are patched together until the game appears to function. Versus the clockwork game design which the auther champions, where the game is built around a core mechanic. Over 4 chapters the author describes a scope for what is a game, what makes up a game, how to go about building a game and common pitfalls in game design. It is a highly focus book, aimed at someone trying to developer a decision making strategy game.

#### Pros

The writing style is concise and clear, the author is unambigous about how focused the book is on a specific type of game.

The outline of the difference between a toy, a puzzle, a contest and a game and how each  provides enjoyment in different way is very illumiating and I will try to do a piece about this at some point.

The author provides good examples, I particularly appreciate using the same games in each example. I think it could hav done with more examples, perhaps a chapter at the end dedicated to more examples.

The book does a good job covering each aspect  of design.

#### Cons 

The author is clear about focusing on strategy games but I sometimes feels it is too focused and not considering enough of other types of games. 



#### Conclusion
