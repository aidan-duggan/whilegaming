Continuing on from my previous boardgames idea post I am very happy with my idea for a game about rugby. 
I have thought about it and I'm thinking hard about how to balance simulations vs abstraction. 
Simulationism would like to try to model everything a player does on a pitch, but that could end up being very boring or impractical!
Abstraction helps reduce the complexity to something more like a boardgame but could remove some of the flavour of the game and stop its feeling like a game of Rugby and just a game with a Rugby theme.

To help my thoughts I found a checklist guide to creating your own boardgame, it advised to answer some questions early on about what you want your game to be like and use these to guide the design.
So here they are:
Target Audience:
Experienced enough boardgamers
What will be fun:
It will pack the tension and dynamics of the sport
Players:
2
Ideal length:
30-45 minutes.
Learning Curve:
Rules should be simple but could be complex to master
Overall game size:
Small size, 14 or so tokens and a couple of desks of cards.
Player Interaction
It is simulating a game of rugby so it is direct iteraction but it should not be a zero sum game if possible.
What choices should there be:
Resource allocation representing what the players can do.
Board position representing where the players are.
Risk v Reward some actions will hinge a bit on luck so this has to be managed.
Is there randomness and how much:
There will be come randomness but ideally it should be well contained.
What themes are being aimed for:
Rugby 7s has a sort of score at any time element to it that ideally should be preserved.
There should be moments of excitement where a player pulls something off and there is lots of action.
Big tackles where a player hits another are a highlight of the sport (for good or bad) that should come through.
Rugby is a lot about trying to expect what the opposition is going to do so it should not always be clear what will happen.
