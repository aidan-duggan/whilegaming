I've been struggling with my rugby boardgame idea and to take a break I finished of painting some of my minitures. This got me thinking about what wargaming rules to play with. It seems an eternal search to find the perfect wargame rules. Naturally some people like strong simulations, that focus on historical accuracy and others prepare abstract for the sake of smoother more balanced play. I can certainly appreciate both sides of the spectrum, but when playing a battle that will take hours I generally like some seblemance of balance!

This has had me thinking about what i would like in my perfect wargame. I think it would be good to list things I like and dislike in wargaming and see if something will come out of it. The most common wargame I play is Memoir 44 and its other historical variants. I think the system perfectly balances between wargame and boardgame. It also manages to deal with the imbalance of historical battles by focusing on fast play time, allowing you to play both sides in a hour slot.
