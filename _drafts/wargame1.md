I've been struggling with my rugby boardgame idea and to take a break I finished of painting some of my minitures. This got me thinking about what wargaming rules to play with. It seems an eternal search to find the perfect wargame rules. Naturally some people like strong simulations, that focus on historical accuracy and others prepare abstract for the sake of smoother more balanced play. I can certainly appreciate both sides of the spectrum, but when playing a battle that will take hours I generally like some seblemance of balance!
