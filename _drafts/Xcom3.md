I finally found the time to finish my xcom aliens. 

For the Thin Men I wasn't sure about painting them the navy they are in the game as I thought it wouldn't show well or would match too close the colour of the Greys. So I started with grey for the suits. After the first one though I wasn't happy, the grey doesnt appear evil or dangerous enough. So I finished a pair so they would at least match and then moved to the navy for the last 3. This looked much better to be honest and I'm quite happy with the results. I have 5 more of the same models  if I want to do more Thin Men.

For the Mutons I went with the green like they are in the game. I thought it might be too like the green I base the models in (it is the same paint). In the end I think it looks good, and the yellow highlights add some more colour variety to my alien models.

With that I've finished my xcom aliens for now. Not is to find some rules to play them with! Also to paint up some xcom soliders.
