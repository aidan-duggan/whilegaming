Start at the beginning

I came across this very interesting video about Arrival and the differences between its screen play and the short story it is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTxvzkwVsQE.

The points raised this video are very interesting and points out all the things that I like most about Science Fiction, its ability to explore humanity and ourselves. I'm a big SciFi fan, regularly reading books, watching films and playing video games. 

I'm currently playing Horizon Zero Dawn and really enjoying it. I'm not usually a fan of fantasy settings, of bows and arrows and the like and in practice this is what Zero Down is, but there is a twist, Horizon Zero Down is set in the future! Humanity seems to have regressed not to fallout level but even further to medival era. 

For some reason to me I find it a much more interesting setting then playing Fantasy games. To me, by being set in the future the game you can bring with you what humanity knows now and explore with it. When the game is set in the past or culturally past (which fantasy usually is) then there is no possible direct cultural thread from the present to the story. When you are in the past when something happens or is done it can be dismissed by saying 'that is how things were done in the past' there is implied perhaps lack of humanities growth. 

The video discuss a lot about how SciFi is used to examine features of humanity and this is true in film, novels and video games. It occured to me again that boardgames are not a media that is conductive to this. Certainly role playing games are, and I'm sure there are some board that aim for it specifically. For films, books and games they both seem to be able to bring across this interesting questions while retaining their entertainment value.

There are definitely some games that tackle deep issues and promote tangental learning but it is not common and for a media that is based completely on player action you think it should be more common.

Why is that?

First and foremost boardgames generally have very little story content on which to hang questions for players to explore. Video games have cut scenes and character dialogs that present the player with new information that they need to process.

Boardgames are also a completely communal experience. While you can share reading a book or watching a movie with someone, the interaction is primarily between you and the media with other peoples involvement coming after. For video games the same is true of the single player but not usually the multiplayer.

I think the necessisty of having multiple people who are focused on having an interactive experience removes the room for new information to be presented to the players. Since these games have to support multiple replays there is no possibilty of information hiding and revelations.

Saying that it occurs to me one boardgame I have played that does bring up interesting questions, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective but I does that by having no replayability and not really caring if it is played by 1 or more people. I have yet to play the Legacy style boardgames but these definitely sound like that could offer some of this type of experience. 

What part does the necessity to have a winner play? Could cooperative games be different? When I think about this, it occurs to me that in video games there is rarely a significant game mechanic affect from any story choices so players are usually free to make these choices and explore there affects knowing it will no prevent their ability to progress and "win".

What can be done?
