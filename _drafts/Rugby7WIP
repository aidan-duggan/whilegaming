As promised in my last post I have started to document the rules for my Rugby 7s baordgame. 
This has really helped me get my thoughts together and document what I've been thinking so far and the questions I need to answer.

### GitHub

This site is managed through github.com an online document version and storage system. It works great to managing text docs and the history of changes made to them.
It is mostly used to manage computer program source code so it also has features to logging issues discovered. When you don't pay github the contents of your documents are public to everyone. 
This is done to encourage people to offically Open Source their programs, but it also acts as an encouragement to get people to pay GitHub and so prevent others seeing their documents. 
Modern writers when writing books keep a history of their revisions (at least I hope they do) and github is a great tool for this. This has lead to some people putting their draft books online as they are writing then, getting early feedback from people as they write.
